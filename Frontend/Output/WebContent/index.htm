        <h3> A quick note about the game and classes </h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Game review</strong><br />
              World of Warcraft (WoW) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) released in 2004 by Blizzard Entertainment. It is the fourth released game set in the fantasy Warcraft universe, which was first introduced by Warcraft: Orcs and Humans in 1994. World of Warcraft takes place within the Warcraft world of Azeroth, approximately four years after the events at the conclusion of Blizzard's previous Warcraft release, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne. Blizzard Entertainment announced World of Warcraft on September 2, 2001. The game was released on November 23, 2004, on the 10th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise.<br />
              With a peak of 12 million subscriptions in October 2010 and Blizzard's final report of 5.5 million subscriptions in October 2015, World of Warcraft remains the world's most-subscribed MMORPG, and holds the Guinness World Record for the most popular MMORPG by subscribers. In January 2014, Blizzard announced that more than 100 million accounts had been created over the game's lifetime.
              </li>
          <li><strong>Class review</strong><br />
            From knights in shiny armor to skulking stalkers and cunning spellcasters, each class in World of Warcraft presents unique challenges and gameplay for you to master. <br />
            Choosing what class you want to be in World of Warcraft is probably the most important choice you will make about your character. Unlike races - which can be changed for a fee - classes are permanent, and cannot be changed once a character has been created. Well, what exactly is a class? A character's class determines what abilities and powers are available to them; what weapons and armor they will use; what combat roles they can fulfil; and to a significant extent their strengths, weaknesses and playstyle. Your choice of class will affect how you play your character, and how you play with others, and each class has something very different to offer.</li>

        <h3> Sentiment Analysis </h3>
        <div>
       
          <h5> Power Word Prism </h5>
           
            <p> From the dawn of Wow, players have always used Blizzard forum to express their ideas about classes they were playing. Blizzard has been using these feedbacks to redesign class abilities to maintain a balance between classes in the world, giving chance to all classes to be played equally.
            <br />
            Sentiment analysis a the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.
            <br />
            It was evident that Blizzard can use sentiment analysis to increase their customer satisfaction in a great deal. That's why we decided to start this project to extract ideas in different aspects of the game based on classes. </p>
