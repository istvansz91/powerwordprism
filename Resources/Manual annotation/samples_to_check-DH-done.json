					"@#$ goes south, but %^-* doesn't go south so often that you can't handle it with Metamorphosis and Last Resort anyway (unless your whole raid is failing).",
					"I'm not saying those trinkets are COMPLETELY useless, but they're definitely worse than other options, because they mean that you're putting that overall extra pressure and responsibility on healers for the benefit of having a 600k (less than a boss melee) absorb from rokmora or a very weak proc 3 or 4 times during a fight from parjesh, both of which will VERY RARELY help you, if ever.I dunno; I just cleared heroic Xavius with two tanks for the first time tonight, and the extra stamina and the clutch heal at low health from Parjesh was very useful for keeping me from death and at high enough hp to survive the dispel with a high amount of stacks (when 6 stacks tick for 1 million a second pre mitigation, the extra stamina can definitely make a difference).",

					"Lastly, the point of having an absorb shield on demand (Nightwell Essence) is not primarily to survive a random hit from a boss' melee - There are plenty of mechanics on the current raid bosses where you take a big enough hit to kill you (or do other nasty stuff) before mitigation, and every bit of further mitigation helps."
