{"Death Knight": [["[Guide]Death Knight 101 (Updated for 7.03)", "22/05/2014 11:27", "Hakuteiken", "This if for all the really new Death Knights; my guide on the class overall. In this guide I'll be covering our resource system, what abilities you have, how they work and what they do. I'll also throw in some suggestions on gameplay that should make things somewhat easier for you.It's worth nothing that Death Knights, at lower levels, are ridiculously powerful which is a state of affairs I found to be really dull when leveling my latest Death Knight; it's not much fun when you're immortal and killing things with 2-3 attacks, but anyway, here goes.First thing's first; Resources-We have two different resources; Runes and Runic Power.We have a total of 6 runes which can be used for any attack that costs Runes; Obliterate, Howling Blast, Festering Strike, Marrowrend etc.-Runic Power is generated from used runes and the amount of runic power generated is based on the rune cost abilities, for example, Howling Blast cost 1 rune, and therefore will generate only 10 runic power, Marrowrend costs 2 runes and will generate 20 runic power.Pretty straight forward on paper. Now we get to how they interact with each other.Runes begin a regeneration cycle of no more than 10 seconds when used; Haste will decrease this time but not by much.If all 6 runes are used in succession, the first 3 runes to be used will begin their recharge, while the remaining 3 will not. The second set of 3 runes will begin their recharge only when the first set is completely recharged.There are certain talents and built in passive abilities to speed this process up; these talents and abilities differ from spec to spec.Blood - Soulgorge; consumes Blood Plague from everything in 30 yards to increase rune recharge.-Blood Tap; restores 1 rune per use, limited to 2 charges.Unlike Frost or Unholy, there is no passive ability that will assist the rune recharge time.Frost - Runic Empowerment; passive, has 1% chance per runic power spent to activate on Frost Strike. After some time testing, I've found it's about 50% chance (5 in 10 Frost Strikes).-Murderous Efficiency; using the Killing Machine effect has a 50% chance to to restore 1 rune.-Horn of Winter; restores 2 runes and generates 10 runic power.-Hungering Rune Weapon; Horn of Winter restores 2 runes and generates 10 runic power while Hungering Rune Weapon restores 1 rune and 5 runic power instantly and then restores runes and runic power every 1.5 seconds for 12 seconds.Unholy - Runic Corruption, passive, has 1.25% chance per runic power spent to activate, granting 100% rune regeneration for a short time. Requires Death Coil. After testing I've found that this works out that +/- 1 in 3 Death Coils will activate Runic Corruption.Abilities - How They WorkEach ability a Death Knight has has a rune or runic power cost. The following are abilities that cost only 1 rune and will generate 10 runic power per use.-Blood Spec:Heart Strike, Death's Caress, Rune Tap, Death and Decay (if talented)Note: Heart Strike generates 15 runic power.-Frost Runes; Howling Blast, Frostscythe (if specced),Remorseless Winter,-Unholy Runes; Scourge Strike (Clawing Shadows, talent), Death and Decay, Epidemic (talent), Outbreak, Chains of Ice, Defile(talent)The following cost two runes and will generate 20 runic power when used.-Blood Spec: Marrowrend-Frost Spec: Obliterate-Unholy: Festering StrikeUnholy retains Army of the Dead at a cost of 3 runes which generates 30 runic power.Runic Power - will activate Runic Empowerment or Runic Corruption via the use of Frost Strike or Death Coil respectively.-Death Coil; usable Unholy spec. It's a ranged attack with 30 yard range and costs 35 runic power. This will also restore 10 energy to your ghoul per Death Coil fired.-Frost Strike; exclusive to Frost spec, single target melee attack.Death Coil and Frost Strike are often best used when you're at, or approaching, 100 runic power, but are ideally used when spaced out across your \"rotation\" which brings me neatly to the next part of the guide.Abilities - What to use and WhenThis will require in-depth guides of their own but there are certain universal abilities you can make use of.-Anti-Magic Shell - use to soak high incoming magic damage; it generates runic power.-Icebound Fortitude - use when you're taking high damage or are about to, or to break and become immune to stuns.-Death Grip - when you need to close the distance to your target or interrupt a crucial cast. The adds on Kilrogg Deadeye is a good example of the uses of Death Grip-Wraith Walk - useful for closing distances and clearing root or slow effects.I'll be preparing basic guides for Blood, Frost and Unholy specs, but those aren't coming before Legion release.For now, as I said, this was meant to cover the very basics of the class for people who haven't played Death Knight before."], ["[Guide]Death Knight 101 (Updated for 7.03)", "22/05/2014 13:38", "Emilboc", "verry nice work! i hope u make a good guide for 2h frost dk, maybe a youtube guide, with stats , enchants, glyph s , best comps for 2v2, 3v3.. for PVP Great job!!!!!"], ["[Guide]Death Knight 101 (Updated for 7.03)", "22/05/2014 23:15", "Hakuteiken", "22/05/2014 14:38Posted by Emilbocmaybe a youtube guideI wish!

There's really only one way to master a spec: Spend days in front of a training dummy.  If you are new, spend an hour reading, then several more practicing; there's no shortcut.I didn't see a mention of the of AMZ and how it interacts with our abilities and our stat weights.  AMS soaking is literally the most important skill in the development of a DK player, giving about an equal boost to Frost and Unholy.  I would have liked to see it highlighted in the guide and specifically how it devalues our haste rating, and why if you simply refuse to use it (there are some out there), you're actually supposed to reforge and gem into haste up to one of the GCD breakpoints.  Maybe leave out the /cancelaura macro for newbies though, they can browse the EJ thread for that later.Addons deserve a mention too I suppose.  A good runic power tracker, decent visible rune trackers and DKDiseases, which is an absolute requirement for Unholy and to an extent Frost for the icon that monitors Soul Reaper.Maybe also give a brief shoutout to Festerblight if a new player comes back here to see where they should advance to when they have the basics down.

Sorry, it doesn't make much sense. CLC DK will track all of the above for you and suggest an ability to use based on available runes, runic power, buffs and procs.

Afflic locks fall into the latter IMO, and end up just staring at their bars the whole fight.Tracking your blood tap charges, your runes, runic power, your available buffs, the strength of your diseases as Unholy ect, allows you to have all the info you need to hand, with the decision down to you of what to press.  CLC technically just provides suggestions of useful abilities, but I imagine if I was new, I'd just the suggestions as the gospel 'correct' answer.  I suppose using the Soul Reaper icon from DKDiseases as Frost is the closest thing to a CLC addon, but really, who when the boss reaches 35% is going to open their character sheet, make a split second mental note of their AP and Wep damage and quickly work out (((Weapon min damage + weapon max damage)/2) *1.3 + (2.4 *(X/ 14)))*1.15*1.04*0.68 + (60000 +1.2X)*1.15*1.05 < (499 + 0.8487X) * 1.10*1.05*1.15 *Mastery value to know if they should use SR?

When I'm not tanking on in arena or RBGs I have myself set as focus which helps me track my buffs; also I use ExtraCD which tracks the cool down of my trinkets and legendary cloak allowing me to align my cool downs for when everything is up.

What separates an OK player from a really good player comes down to buff tracking alone imo.  How on earth do you time PoF and ideal ERW? GEV MAI UR SECRETZ!  I'd not track the metagem or legendary procs ofc; they're so passive and proc so often they're not part of any meaningful decision making process, and I don't track it on any of my chars.And for the customisation of CLC, I still worry that new players would only play with the custom settings after some time when the damage is done and the bad habits are set...  I just had a play with it now and it recommended PS over HB on Garrosh with the P1 adds, just because my main target (the Wolfrider), had no Blood Plague.

This weapon even has basic stats which is mastery and haste. Traits should contain such things that increases attack speed and better runic attenuation from FDK talents. The things I said is not difficult, it is just simply requires Blizz's effort. #MakeFDKsGreatAgainPS: you can be salty about scythe because afflis and balances use it, so what then. Why not for FDK?Right lets now look at why a Frost DK Shouldn't have a Scythe, Its actually a Farming tool, it is Impractical for Melee Combat on EVERY LEVEL AND PHYSICALITY, its a STICK Swinging at it from Certain Angles would cause it to instantly be Snapped, also, if u look to the Illidari, they Use the Scythe of Souls which has Nothing to do with \"cold\".No, the Relation to that idea is the Grim Reaper wields a Scythe, and being in death is Cold, which is said as \"the touch of Death is Cold\" Where actually the grim reaper in concept simply leads those who are Ready into Death, at no place does he actually COLLECT trheir souls in the scythe.to this Day 2handed for Either Specc of DK have supplied two Runeforging, if we made it as a 2handed class, the Proc rate would just have been increased.Frostscythe Merges ur blades together into a Frozen Scythe in animation, its a very unique Animation and in all honesty supplies everything in its Name, it looks amazing, and Implements the Idea of a Scythe in the Best way, Using ur blades as Hilts of Frost.Scythes Look stupid No matter how they look in Melee Combat, Casting howling blast with ur Scythe pointed at the Enemy would Look ridiculous, Lich Kings Animation With his blade Pointed Forward Looks 100x Better.FROST DK IS BUILT ON 1HANDED CONCEPT.Lich King, WIELDS ONE HANDED, he is the PURE Concept of a Frost Death Knight, just because he wields nothing in the offhand doesn't auto make the Weapon a 2handed, by its SIZE and how its WIELDED the Weapon is a 1handed weapon.the concept of wielding a 2handed, is Understandable, people have their Preferences, however concept of wielding a Scythe on the bases of a Representation of the Grim reaper, is Terrible.this is WoW, not Real Representation, and at no point is the Scythe represented by Coldness.Look at the Scythes.Scythe of Souls - Fel Powered.Scythe of Elune - Balanced Powered.. Lunar... Goddess..not even the COLDEST WEapon of Existance the Frostmourne was a Scythe.Frostmourne Represents Coldness and Death like no other by what it stands for, its a 1handed Sword, much like the Weapons we have, the Reason its based on Shards of frostmourne is Because blizzard had to make a Decision.we could wield a 1handed looking weapon with 1handed Animations based on the Lich king with the stats and Damage of a 2handed Weapon put upon it, which would make problems where attack speed etc etc would make a Major balancing Problem.or they some how made a Secondary weapon for it.I personally, would have liked the Idea very close to the Shamans concept, that wielding the Frostmourne allowed us to Craft a Weapon from the Ice Around us.or Even betterWielded Frostmourne as a 1handed Weapon and when we go into Combat, Using certain abilities such as Remorseless Winter made us Split the Frostmourne into 2 and Use them In concession for the Fast paced Battle.no matter how u look a tthis.Much like a ENhancement Shaman, the 2handed Concept existed for the Death Knight, however it was Never blizzards orginal intention, Arthus was a Frost DK and he did not wield a 2handed weapon.. we're built on that concept.they finally removed it completely just like 2handed Enhancement, do I believe it will ever return? no I don't. I think once our class is unlocked from artifacts next expansion, they'll make attacks 1handed only Disabling 2handed for good.2handed was Never the beginning concept, like enhancement Shamans we'll have to accept that.Unholy - 2handedFrost - Dual Wield..Offers Difference, variety and both players Concepts.. while defining the Speccs by the not only Abilities but their Individual Apperances. is that a bad thing? no. is it to everyones Preference?.. no, imho they should have learned from enhancement Shaman.. and Kept this option Definitive, Preventing one of the variables from ever existing.. thus Never causing these problems."], ["Bring back 2H-Frost DK... in an cosmetic way", "29/11/2016 21:13", "Arthemida", "I will be happy if Frost DK gets skin in main hand 2handed Frostmourne and off hand Skull of Sindragosa as shield.But it never go to happen.

Since Legion beginning. Not only because DK was on bottom of the meters etc, NO. It's the fact that if someone wants to play frost... He have to take this non DK matching dual wield style... Just WHY? I saw last weeks ago a topic about \"Bring back 2H FDK\". Tbh i dont want the physical playstyle back from 2H FDK. It wasnt better in any way then the dw magic dmg playstyle. Maybe only against casters it was a bit effektive.Anyways. My thoughts about to bring back 2H-FDK was to give them a cosmetic way. I just cant play and take the specc serious with this DW style. Its just annoying... Pls if any def from blizz read this *cough* Bring it on the table. Give the option to mogg those 2 1hands into a 2H and some kinda frostmourne look alike artifact appearences.

However I am biased, I have a replica frostmourne hanging on the wall, and a history of downloading frostmourne mods for other games, so fair to say I would love a frostmourne ingame. Though personally think warlock green fire quest would be the better route to go, ie not tied to a single spec/artifact.In terms of dw mechanics, off the top of my head what is currently the offhand strike is added as a frost component to the main strike for obliterate/auto/death strike. For frostscythe/frost strike call the offhand hit a echo of damage caused by the wounds or the icy attack rupturing the wound.As for runeforges, runeforging a 1h weapon covers the whole blade, 2h weapon only covers 1 side.
