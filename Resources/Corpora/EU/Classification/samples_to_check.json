[["Hello,Id like to start by saying that Im really bad at composing a long line of text, so im gonna try to keep it as constructive as possible, Ive been playing Blood DK for the past 4+ years, never have I even though about switching class, because they day I stop playing DK is the day I stop playing wow, I always had all classes which have tank spec on max level, so I could compare blood to them, I never felt so weak like I am right now, bellow I will try to say why and what I would like to change, keep in mind that Im no mathematical genius and this is just opinion of then hc, now semi hc raider and someone, who is really passionate about DKs.-Out mastery is lackluster, every expansion we were either set on big selfheals, or big absorb shields, in Legion it feels like they tried to get a bit of both and it ended as both being bad-Consumption is the most underwhelming Artifact ability all tanks currently have, in most raiding scenarios it heals less then death strike and the best way of handling it is just to use it on cooldown for the dps, absolutely needs rework-Bone shield looks like a good idea on paper untill you get into bossfights like Cenarius, where keeping your boneshields up and also actually generating runic power for self heals seems nearly impossible and I end up shouting for specific externals nearly every moment my vamp blood or DRW is off cooldown -Out talent choice is extremely limited, for a raid or dungeon environment, only possible switches for talents you could make is Bonestorm/Purgatory and Possibly Rune Tap/Foul Bulwark-Our cooldown choice is underwhelming, remember back in the days where the good DK was the one who knew which cooldown to press when ?", "Now we dont have any choice at all.", "Some bosses cant even be parried and overall DRW is just RNG based parry chance, Vampiric Blood is good and so is AMS, but is that enough ?", "Why isnt Rune Tap baseline ?", "-In higher end mythic dungeons, for example Smashspite on mythic 10+ just oneshots us, there is no way to actually mitigate damage, even with properly rotating cooldown, this design choice feels unfaif and we shouldnt be punished for picking a specific spec.-The nerf of Gorefiends Grasp hurt us badly and wasnt necessary.", "-Wraith walk is just bad and everyone who I ever asked would preffer to have the passive movement speed from Deaths Advance back + the ability itself is incredibly clunky without the glyph.", "Possible solutions -Buff our mastery by a big chunk-Make Rune Tap baseline-Give DRW a mitigation effect-Give us more passive movement speed, all we do is walk, we should atleast be good at it-Mix up the talent choices so we choose them by utility, not perfomance-Put the person who came with Wraith walk into a rocket and shoot him to MarsAlso I love what you did to Unholy and Frost, Unholy is by far the most fun Ive had in ages when it comes to dps, but both of the specs scale so incredibly poorly and Death coil is underwhelming, what about giving it a stacking speed buff or something so its fun to press and make Dark Transformation off of GCD :) Make DKs great again !"],
